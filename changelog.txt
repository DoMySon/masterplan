v0.6.1-2

-------

Removing itch / Steam forums options.
Removing Steam purchase option from demo (as the demo's only on itch for now, so it doesn't make much sense to add a Steam purchase option).
FIX: Textboxes wered shared between copied Tasks.

-------

v0.6.1-1

-------

FIX: MasterPlan crashing on start when creating a brand new project.

-------

v0.6.1

-------

Progression Tasks now have buttons to increment and decrement the values (when selected).
Broken sound icon updated for enhanced readability.
Tasks no longer glow so heavily, as that was making certain themes visually difficult to parse.
The theme Cloudy's colors have been tweaked. It is now lower contrast and more blue-tinted, overall.
Adding Waves, yet another dark theme.
Slightly tweaking checkbox and parent checkbox GUI icons to be more readable at a glance.
Adding loading plans from arguments back in. This was previously merged in a PR by @DanielKilgallon on 8/27 (#27), but apparently it got unmerged at some point. I'm re-adding it manually here.
Textboxes have been generally and drastically refactored to handle text more reliably and be more optimized in rendering and typing / usage. (Note that there is currently a GPU VRAM-related memory leak with textboxes as they expand, so be mindful of this.)
Blinking caret is now visible for 75% of the time, and blinks twice as often (every half-second), rather than 50% of the time, blinking every second.
Skipping words and lines with holding Control + arrow keys is now more exact, skipping to the boundaries of words rather than including spaces and necessitating more key presses to skip past those spaces. New lines are still "individualized" (so pressing Control+up skips to the end of the last word on the previous line still, for example).
Optimizing Textbox rendering code.
Moving between lines in Textbox has been tweaked to be simpler and easier to maintain on my side.
Consolidating options into rows for Project settings / tweaking wording.
Adding option to pan to mouse pointer when zooming in.
Adding button to default keyboard shortcuts.
Left click now cancels keyboard shortcut assignment, freeing up Escape as a key to use for assigning shortcuts.
Adding two more outer zoom levels.
Textboxes now can contain more text than just what fits within the box by using render textures.
By default, Textboxes now are centered vertically and expand vertically, but not horizontally.
GUIElement now has both Update() and Draw() because rendering textbox text to a texture can't be done in the draw loop where the Panel that contains it is transforming the elements to draw onto its texture.
Adding button to reset font settings back to default.
Adding option to turn off camera pan smoothing.
Adding options to change MasterPlan's font and font size.
Removing GUI font, as it's the same as the normal font, just displaying larger.
Fonts are now internally loaded at size 30, and then scaled up or down as desired.
Scroll wheel sensitivity raised, maximum is 10.
Scrolling panels with mouse wheel is smooth now.
Changing Task Type from a drop-down menu to a ButtonGroup for easier selection.
Changing how scroll wheel works for scrollbars in Panels - previously, it would scroll by a percentage. Now it scrolls by a set "chunk" size (so smaller lists are scrolled just as easily as larger ones).
Adding scroll wheel sensitivity to program settings.
Adding a setting for UnfocusedFPS. This allows you to set the target FPS when the window is minimized, hidden, or unfocused. It defaults to 60 FPS and the lowest value is 1.
Adding graphical options in settings.
    - Adding option for Graphical Tasks (like images, whiteboards, or maps) can now be transparent when changing global Task transparency.
    - Adding option for deadline animation, so that it can be as understated or distracting as desired.
Clicking on Tasks no longer visually raises them.
Logging improvements. Errors should now be logged onscreen. (This could be due to things like not having a valid clipboard tool installed on Linux, for example.)
MasterPlan now stores its settings and log file in the XDG-standard local user configuration directory. For Linux, this should be ~/.config/MasterPlan, for Mac OS, ~/Library/Preferences/MasterPlan, and for Windows, C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\MasterPlan.
Logging improvements. MasterPlan now prints when it is initialized and exited properly - just this can help to ensure that the log is set up properly and writing. Logging is also cleaned up / less cluttered in case of a crash.
Whiteboards can now be inverted.
Sliding Tasks should now be a bit more optimized and less CPU-intensive.
Notes and other Task types can now extend a list of numberable Tasks.
Overall optimizations for textboxes and placing Tasks.
FIX: Progression Tasks no longer list subtasks; now only Checkbox Tasks properly "list" sub-tasks.
FIX: Textboxes now allow dragging above the textbox to select text at the beginning.
FIX: Panels can be dragged offscreen when holding the mouse button down.
FIX: Board.PasteContent() no longer prints an error if the item could not be loaded, as that is an acceptable outcome.
FIX: Textboxes not updating after resetting them.
FIX: Canceling screenshot directory or custom font path setting should not set it to "" (a blank string).
FIX: Resizing a Task individually previously didn't trigger the undo system; now this is fixed.
FIX: Undo no longer "un-destroys" Tasks when undoing all the way to the beginning of the .
FIX: MasterPlan no longer crashes when attempting to remove deleted previously opened plans.
FIX: Numberable Tasks now take priority in lists. Previously, either numberable Tasks or other Tasks (like Notes) would take priority, meaning Notes would make Task lists number inconsistently.
FIX: WM_CLASS on Linux no longer has the version number. This is achieved by simplifying the window title on creation. It is simply the program name at the beginning.
FIX: ProgramSetttings are no longer reset on program start. This was because the Project.ProjectSettingsOpen variable is set to true in case of showing the About Dialog, but then the global settings (like, say, the TargetFPS) isn't set to point to the global ProgramSettings values (this only was done correctly if manually opening the Settings dialog from the right-click menu).
FIX: Crash when changing themes on tutorial. This was due to the color switching process for Whiteboards.
FIX: Sliding Tasks now works properly for "larger" Tasks that take up more space than a single row (images, Notes). Sliding Tasks in a direction occupied by an existing Task will attempt to have the Tasks swap positions (if the spaces are free).
FIX: Adding a duration for repeating keybindings. This also fixes keybindings repeating faster at higher FPS values.
FIX: Editing shortcuts (backspace, delete, etc) no longer repeat faster depending on FPS when editing text.
FIX: Whiteboards weren't the correct colors on load because the MessageThemeChange message wasn't sent when setting the theme through the ChangeTheme() function.
FIX: Can't use the left Super / Apple key on Mac.

-------

v0.6.0

-------

Adding keybindings. Keys can now be rebound from the settings screen.
Adding Whiteboard Task Type. Whiteboards serve to allow for drawing images in your plan. Note that the drawings can balloon the size of the plan dramatically, so it's best used sparingly or for simple drawings / idea sketches.
Adding the project file name to the window title.
MapImages can now be cleared through GUI.
MapImage now only shows its editing button when selected.
Rewriting Image / Map / Whiteboard resizing code.
Selected Tasks raise them up to visually be "on top".
Updating help manual.

FIX: Held keybinding triggers more reliably.
FIX: MapImage no longer stays in edit mode when resizing.
FIX: Errant / non-existant entries in recent plan list are removed when opening context menu.
FIX: The Project Setting Auto Reload Resources is now unchecked by default.
FIX: Default zoom level is now correctly set to 100%.
FIX: Can't click on the edit button for Maps or Whiteboards and quickly start drawing.
FIX: Undoing is now more consistent internally.
FIX: Tasks now stay selected when undoing or redoing.
FIX: Panels can no longer close if a GUI element is "open" or "activated".
FIX: Panel spacing fixes.
FIX: You no longer have to hold Shift and Alt to deselect Tasks, but rather just Alt.
FIX: Switching to Boards using a key binding now announces this via the Log.
FIX: Line Tasks no longer point to their base, but rather a different neighboring Task.
FIX: Program timing fixes.
FIX: Images are no longer always at least slightly transparent.
FIX: Some GIFs were previously displaying incorrectly.
FIX: Can't display resources that are linked to by URLs.
FIX: Can't use partial URLs for resources. (This allows for usage of "abc.com/image.png" instead of "https://abc.com/image.png", as an example.)

-------

v0.5.4-1

-------

MasterPlan now saves window position on exit (by default).
Screenshot save directory can now be customized on a per-project basis (thanks to Oscar over on GitHub!â€‹).
MasterPlan now alerts you to where a screenshot is saved.
Cleaned up splashscreen.
FIX: Demo was disallowing saving improperly.

-------

v0.5.4

-------

Adding a demo. The demo mode is the same as the paid version, just with the inability to save projects and a different "About" section in the settings.
Improving general autosave reliability.
Windows executable now has proper MasterPlan icon and properties.
Dropping a text file onto MasterPlan will now create a Note of its contents.
FIX: Image size being reset on project save / load.
FIX: Task.LoadResource() shouldn't attempt to use an Audio Resource that didn't load properly. This fixes a crash where you can attempt to play a sound that didn't load.
FIX: Add logging messages for when you drop an image, sound, or text file onto MasterPlan successfully.
FIX: Dropping a local sound file onto MasterPlan no longer renames it if it has an incorrect extension name.

-------

v0.5.3

-------

- Timing improvements. Previously, MasterPlan was timed using Vsync; this is now replaced with my own timing system using time.sleep(), which should be more cross-platform friendly and make the main goroutine pause without consuming CPU execution. Otherwise, higher refresh rates would cause faster execution speeds (making things like double-clicking or moving using WASD quasi-impossible) or making the CPU idle at high cost as raylib currently seems to internally use a busy-wait-while loop by default on Mac and Linux. This timing mechanism isn't perfect, but is relatively easy to implement and seems accurate enough.
- Adding experimental option to automatically reload media. This is experimental because it seems like it might be possible to mangle media if MP detects and goes to load a file before the OS is finished writing it. I believe I've mitigated this, but it's still experimental until more people test it out. It also does this every frame for every Task, so it's also a bit slow for the moment.
- Adding transparent and borderless window. Props to pureref.com for the idea!
- Adding quit option to context menu; the context menu is now slightly thinner and no longer has spacers to account for this.
- Adding Target FPS option to global program settings.
- FIX: Previously was unable to "refresh" a Task that used media; whatever was loaded was stuck like that until you reloaded the project or MasterPlan. Now when prompted to load media (e.g. after closing the Task), MasterPlan will check to see if the media on disk is newer than the media already loaded; if so, it will reload it.

-------

v0.5.2-1

-------

- FIX: JPG images aren't loading.

-------

v0.5.2

-------

- FIX: Paths are serialized relative to the project root.
- FIX: Images weren't loading with proper size.
- Lines now have outlines.
- Line Tasks no longer draw inside of squares.
- Map background colors are darker for light themes and lighter for dark themes.
- Remove FPS cap. Instead, MasterPlan will be tied to Vsync for timing; this seems to keep the CPU from using busy wait loop idling (see raylib's issue #217), lowering CPU requirements.
- Allowing panning with the middle mouse button while editing Tasks or Project settings.
- Minor graphical fixes and changes.
- Pressing a Spinner to expand its menu will now display all options in the list.
- EventHorizon theme's colors tweaked to be more readable.
- FIX: Tasks and their copies were linked unintentionally (where changing the deadline or completion status on one would influence the other).
- The view no longer focuses on pasted Tasks.
- Lines are drawn on top of Tasks now.
- Bullet numbering sequences use a proper icon rather than the letter "o".
- Adding Square and Star numbering sequences.
- Rearranging GUI elements for editing Tasks and Project settings.
- Maps are now always behind other Tasks.
- Panel shadows have been added, and are now colored according to the theme.
- Adding smoother zoom steps to mouse wheel.
- Making zoom reach further on keyboard.
- The Task selection square changes color to increase visibility.
- FIX: Can't open project settings after opening a Spinner and closing with Escape.
- Adding option to turn off glowing for incomplete, complete, and selected Tasks.
- FIX: Flat shadows darken Maps' backgrounds.
- Adding SoundVolume project property to control how loudly sounds play through MasterPlan.
- Theme colors tweaked for Dark Crimson, Moonlight, and ZERO.
- URLs entered in Tasks (e.g. "google.com") now become buttons that take you to the site when clicked. URL Buttons are displayed when holding the Ctrl key, or are always displayed if the new project settings option is enabled. They display on Note, Progression, and Checkbox Tasks.
- Settings panel fleshed out to be separated into categories using a button group.
    - FIX: It was previously possible to double-click outside of a Task Edit panel or the Project Settings panel and immediately create and edit a Task. This has been fixed.â€‹
- FIX: Panels weren't properly sized, and would require scrollbars even when all of their elements were properly being displayed.
- FIX: Spinners' menus expanding should expand the Panel, creating a scrollbar if necessary.
- FIX: Can no longer paste Line Endings to a different Board than their base.
- FIX: Copying Lines works more reliably now.
- FIX: Copying Lines no longer moves the ending down a cell.
- FIX: You can now properly undo line movement and creation if two Line Tasks end on the same point.
- FIX: Line endings that were on the same location no longer rotate when being dragged.
- Adding About page to settings with buttons leading to community / social media pages.
- Removing version name from top-right.
- Renaming "Help" option "Open Tutorial" and moving it lower in the context menu.

-------

v0.5.1

-------

- Project lock is now undone when the corresponding setting is unchecked in project settings, not just when the settings panel is actually closed.
- Adding a grid and a placement indicator to editing MapImages.
- FIX: Shifting new Map Task crashed MP.
- FIX: There was a slight lag between panning camera and task position updating (this could have caused a bit of a motion sickness inducing effect when panning previously).
- FIX: Backups weren't being made on Windows.
- FIX: Loading resources had the working directory as root for determining the path to the resources, not the project's filepath.
- FIX: Images weren't loading with proper size.

-------

v0.5.0

-------

- Adding Map Task. Map Tasks allow you to draw a shape (like a room layout, or basic map for a town / continent) for your projects.
- Adding global Task Transparency to project settings.
- Adding option to disable message log in project settings.
- Line Tasks now end in a point if placed on other Tasks (like Map Tasks).
- Working on GUI; project settings and task editing windows are now smaller and can be moved by dragging the top bar.
- You can now click outside windows to close them.
- Option Choice GUI elements (like the theme or a Task's type) can now be clicked in the center to open a menu showing their options.
- Image / Sound Tasks now automatically use cross-platform friendly relative paths when saving and loading.
- Rewording project lock text at top-right when a project is locked.
- Adding improved graphic for checkboxes.
- Golden Hour theme's inside panel color is now a bit more contrasting.
- Sunlight theme now has a slightly brighter blue.
- Dark Crimson theme's note color altered to be visually distinct from other colors.
- Updated manual.
- FIX: Resizeable Tasks get stuck resizing if not released over MasterPlan window.
- FIX: Undo after load destroys Line Tasks.
- FIX: Only completable Tasks should display their due date.
- FIX: Alarm sound not playing correctly sometimes.
- FIX: Board names aren't being saved.
- FIX: Pasting Tasks now centers on the cursor.
- FIX: Image resizing squares only get doubled in size to improve "grabability" if at least 32x32.
- FIX: Tasks now cannot be resized by clicking on them when unselected in the resizing area.
- MacOS system requirements should now be 10.14 and above.

-------

v0.4.0

-------

- Updating splashscreen.
- Adding undo / redo. FINALLY. Note that Tasks no longer are deleted like before; - this is done because they could be restored. HOPEFULLY THIS DOESN'T COME BACK TO BITE ME.
- Fix: Cloned Tasks have unique IDs.
- Fix: Right clicking when project settings is open closes the menu.
- Fix: NumberSpinner is positioned properly (or just more correctly) in settings menu.
- Serialization (saving and loading) of Tasks / Projects improved.
- FIX: Project SampleRate isn't loaded properly. 
- Redirecting log output of MasterPlan to a file ("log.txt", in the same folder as MasterPlan) so that errors and crashes can be sent to me by reference. 
- Adding automatic backups. Automatic backups happen every X minutes, configurable by the user. MP will automatically delete the oldest backups that exceed the maximum count.
- FIX: Progression completion current and max can no longer go below 0.
- MasterPlan no longer asks for project directory on save. Now it asks for the project file name itself, sensibly.
- FIX: If the last loaded project doesn't exist, MP no longer crashes.
- FIX: Messages logged are clearer and easier to read with indentations and dashes ("-").
- FIX: Errors for failures when loading projects are no longer displayed (and logged) twice.
- FIX: Message logging now works correctly with multiple lines per message (\n).
- FIX: Deadlines can no longer show up on un-completable Tasks by setting the deadline on a un-completableâ€‹ Task, and then changing its type.

-------

v0.3.1

-------

- Fix: Can't load projects (whoops, this was a major, but extremely simple, bug).

-------

v0.3.0

-------

- Adding a Line Task type. Lines have arrow heads that can be positioned as desired. To make more lines from the same start point, simply copy and paste the line ending.
- Adding help entry to right-click menu. This loads a tutorial plan to walk through to help learn the program.
- Adding ability to rearrange the order of Boards by means of the buttons next to the active Board name.
- Reworked how Tasks are stored internally, which should HOPEFULLY improve efficiency.
- Default theme for new projects is now always Sunlight.
- MasterPlan title bar now adds a * when the project has been modified.
- Autosaving is now indicated at top-right of MasterPlan.
- MasterPlan now asks for confirmation when destructively changing the current project (save as, new project, load project).
- Tasks that are copy-pasted are now directly placed where the mouse points, like cutting.
- Parent Tasks now only count their direct Sub-tasks' completion statuses for completion, not all leaves.
- Sub-tasks can now be visually bracketed into their parent Task. This option enhances readability at a glance.
- Adding ability to move all Tasks in all directions (not just numberable Tasks, and not just up and down) by means of holding Control.
- Board switching shortcuts are now Shift+numbers. More comfortable, sensible defaults.
- Adding ability to select Tasks in direction from selected Task using arrow keys.â€‹
- Renaming Project Settings > Settings in context menu.
- Fix: Repositioning the "<" button for find + replace.
- Fix: Can't close Tasks when editing them (was sending wrong message on "X" button press).
- Fix: Tasks not being numbered properly, after closing a Task.
- Fix: Cam center no longer depends on window size.
- Fix: Copying and cutting pastes tasks so the center of all pasted Tasks hits where the mouse cursor is.
- Fix: Updating excel.ttf to fix ; and : characters being too low. Adding & character as well.
- Fix: Tasks not being selected on load when they were on save.
- Fix: \n runes can be highlighted in Textbox.
- Fix: Can't search for timers by their name.
- Fix (?): Searchbar now expands as you type.
- Fix: Project settings options are now more properly spaced.
- Adding ability to lock Projects. This disables saving after saving once after the option has been enabled. Useful for locking projects in a specific state to ensure they aren't accidentally modified.
- Fix: Closing task edit window doesn't flip Project.Modified tag / create the opportunity for auto-saving - this was because I was calling task.ReceiveMessage instead of project.SendMessage (which is what ESC was doing on project, so it shouldn't be a huge deal to migrate it to task.go).
- Fix: Switching between projects should be more efficient now, as resources are now freed from the previous project.
- Fix: Temporary files created during resource download process weren't being deleted properly.
- Fix: Pan now defaults to 0,0 for new Projects.
- Fix: Autosaving now works on fewer actions (just adding tasks, editing tasks, moving tasks, deleting tasks, and changing the project settings). This makes it less of a chore to work with. 
- Fix: Autosave no longer triggers during load (this was wholly unnecessary). 
- Fix: Description now has focus on when going to edit a Task.
- MasterPlan now has an icon and is more "app-like" on Mac.

-------

v0.2.3

-------

You can now disable the splashscreen on startup.
You can now rename Boards. Adding a button for this, the Rename button, to the right of the currently active Board.
Adding Cloudy theme.
MasterPlan's text rendering is now Unicode character compliant (this means that common Latin characters for non-English languages like Ã€ or Ã† can be typed and display correctly). 
Note that I'm designing the characters myself, so not every character for every Latin-based language is implemented currently. Let me know on the forums if a language is missing
characters: https://itch.io/board/555951/general
Switching out the font from Monaco to my own, Excel.
FIX: Can't release mouse over status bar.
FIX: Selection rectangle offset over the individual characters when selecting text in Textbox.
FIX: Text selection and highlighting improved, fixed for center-aligned text.
FIX: Task and its clone share deadline properties.
FIX: Can't choose image files to load on Mac.

-------

v0.2.2

-------

Adding option to disable Task Outlines.
Images now lock to a grid when scaling - to disable this, hold shift while dragging their size.
Adding an "Open Recent" menu to the right-click context menu.
Making Open Recent menu have an option stating no recent plans have been opened if that's the case, rather than being blank.
MP can now take screenshots without the GUI using the F11 shortcut or the Screenshot context menu option.
Projects now save which Board is active.
Adding 3D shadow type.
Lengthening smooth shadow slightly.
Filtering images using anisotropic filtering for clearer zooming.
Program settings file is now called "masterplan-settings.json".
Updating a few themes to update shadow color.
Fix: Can't select the task below the top-most Task on the Board using the keyboard.
Fix: Settings is always saved next to the MasterPlan executable.
Fix: Autoloading last plan wasn't being loaded properly.
Fix: Numbering sequence was broken across all Boards except the first one. 
Fix: Auto-load checkbox not properly loaded on running MasterPlan.
Fix: All Tasks update now. Before it was just the ones on the current Board. This fixes timers and sounds not playing when switching Boards.
Fix: Stopping all playing sounds works across all Boards.
Fix: Searching for a Task switches to the Board it resides on.
Fix: Boards are now numbered starting from 1, rather than 0.

-------

v0.2.1

-------

Added Boards. A Board represents a collection of Tasks. Boards are selected by utilizing the Board selection menu at the top-right (or an 
    associated shortcut, which is Ctrl + 1, 2, 3..., 0). You can add Boards by clicking on the + button in that same menu. Empty Boards (Boards
    that don't contain any Tasks) are deleted if they are not open.
Added the Board number on the grid background at origin (0, 0).
Added Cut Tasks option and shortcut. Pasting cut Tasks move them to the mouse's position.
Fixed wording of Log messages that mention "Tasks" to mention "Task(s)" instead (to cover singular Task use cases).

You can now configure the sound playback sample rate in the Project Settings.
Sample rate is now set to 22050 by default (the only sample rate that seems to play sounds back flawlessly in my tests, oddly) on Mac.
Fix: Unable to load .plan files on Mac because the most recent Mac OS version seems to have trouble recognizing file extensions in some cases. So 
    instead, I'm just removing the filter on the File Open dialog for now.
Fix: On Mac, shortcuts can now use Super instead of Control. Note that I'm still allowing people to use Control for those shortcuts as well if they 
    prefer.
Loading saved plans are validated a little bit more - if the file loaded isn't valid JSON or does not have a "Tasks" entry, then the load will fail 
    gracefully.
Fix: New Tasks now are created beneath the top-most selected Task, regardless of numbering sequence.
Pasting Tasks now pastes them below the last Task selected, in the same column.
Fix: Dragging image or sound files over MasterPlan create associated Tasks, but don't automatically load the media.

_______

v0.2.0
_______

Fix: Splashscreen not displaying on Mac build.
Splash screen now displays for 1.5 seconds minimum.
Hopeful Fix: Set application build type to GUI on Windows, making it so the command prompt doesn't appear when running.
FIX: Task bar not filling for Timer when running.
Adding splash screen.
FIX: Task completion time constantly set on save for parent Tasks with completed subtasks.
Adding Timer Task type. The Timer allows people to add Timers to their plan, allowing them to better control how and when they work. It allows for 
    Pomodoro-style timing-based workflows (work for x minutes, rest for y minutes, repeat) into their daily development. Timers that are next to 
    each other trigger in sequence, much like Sound Tasks.
Sound Tasks now have buttons for playing, pausing, and restarting sounds.
Completing Tasks with [C] now is displayed as a notification.
Deadline patterns cycle faster to indicate urgency.
Changed deadline icons and patterns a bit.

FIX: Couldn't type caps in textbox after Ctrl+A to select all text.
FIX: Couldn't hold shift and click to select text.
Saving version number in .plan save file. This is to allow backwards compatibility being built in with previous saves in case features are added, changed, or removed.
FIX: Crash if starting MasterPlan and Autoload Last Project setting didn't save.

Major changes - Resource management improvements.
Resources (images and GIFs) are now stored in a central location on the Project and are reused between Tasks.
Resource downloading and loading has been improved by the addition of the usage of a MIME type detection library. This allows for MasterPlan to see 
    what kind of file a file is after downloading, even if the file doesn't have the correct filepath. This means that Paste Content now works much 
    more reliably across media found on the Internet.
Lengthening the amount of time messages are on screen (5 seconds to 7 seconds).
Escape key now defocuses textboxes.
Enter key now is also a shortcut to jump to the next Task in a search when the searchbar is highlighted (like Ctrl+F). Shift+Enter goes back (much like Shift+Ctrl+F).
Adding project setting to save sounds that are currently playing.

FIX: Percentage didn't fill a Task if under 1% filled. That value has now been bumped to 0.01%.
FIX: Log reporting selection and deselection of Tasks was incorrect.
FIX: Pasting Tasks now lowers them below the column of existing Tasks (if the Task is completable). A TODO is to make all Tasks able to have 
    neighbors so you can shift them around easily using the keyboard.
FIX: Crash if using Ctrl+V to paste Tasks with no Tasks copied.
FIX: Crash if playing resampled audio and looping it multiple times (4-6 in my tests on a specific file). This seems to be FIXed by lowering the 
    quality of resampling (quality of 4 > quality of 1).
FIX: Hang when deleting Tasks due to Tasks registering their neighbors that include themselves, resulting in a loop (A.TaskAbove = B, B.TaskAbove = 
    A). This is resolved by comparing Task positions more absolutely to determine whether a Task is another's neighbor.

Massive textbox improvements.
You can now select blocks of text in textboxes, either by mouse click and drag, or by holding shift and using the keyboard.
Ctrl + A selects all Text.
You can now copy, paste, and cut text to/from the system clipboard in textboxes.
FIX: Navigating text lines by keyboard in textboxes is no longer as inaccurate. Clicking on lines is also vastly improved.

You can now move multiple Tasks at a time with the keyboard.
You can now select multiple Tasks using Shift + up or down arrow.
Ctrl + arrow keys now move Tasks, rather than Shift. This is a bit more awkward, but more consistent with how holding shift allows for selecting 
    multiple Tasks with the mouse.
Moving Tasks no longer adjusts the indentation. This seems better to keep Tasks arranged consistently and not jump around when moving groups of 
    Tasks around.
Escape now deselects all Tasks.
Page Up and Page Down now selects the first or last Task in a column, respectively.
FIX: Shadows no longer render on top of Tasks.
FIX: You can now pan while dragging Tasks.
FIX: Projects couldn't restore the pan of the camera from saved plans. To resolve this, creating new Tasks now no longer focuses the view on them.
HOPEFUL FIX: Zoom locks when close to targeted zoom. Seems like I was getting some artifacting at 1x zoom level, but I can't seem to reproduce it 
    reliably. This should help make sure the zoom never stays at fractional levels.

Other assorted code rearrangings and minor fixes.

_______

v0.1.2
_______

MasterPlan now maintains global program settings in an external file.
FIX: Crash due to color theme spinner pointing to a theme that no longer exists if a theme is deleted or renamed.
FIX: Minor shadow bug (shadow blitting should be down by a pixel to not have jank on outer vertical edge).
Shadows are now "brighter" / denser.
Color theme spinner is wider now.
Themes reload when opening project settings now.
Adding Shade Thrower 3099 cyberpunk theme.
Changing notification fading from linear to cubic interpolation, making it easier to read for longer before it disappears.
Adding an icon for broken sounds.
More notifications display for loading images and sounds.
FIX: #7 - Backspace teleports to origin for a frame before animating pan.
New Tasks are opened after creation.
Adding option for autoloading last saved project.
FIX: Context menu now never opens offscreen (#9).
FIX: Current value can't go above maximum for Progression Tasks. (#12)

Other assorted code rearrangings and minor fixes.
