Whoops, I deleted the previous todo list as well. :(

That really sucks, actually.

-- Rough Changelog --

Completed:

- Completely reworked the Undo system; should be slightly more optimized (and is simpler in the code-base, as well).
- Completely rewrote a large portion of the Task update and drawing system; may be more optimized, but is simpler in the code-base as well.
- Now only Check-box Tasks display Sub-Tasks as contributing to their own completion; not Progression Tasks.
- Downloading images / sounds are now multithreaded.
- Modifiers (left ctrl, right ctrl) are now left / right agnostic.
- Added repeatable Timers / deadline.
- Added a Daily mode for Timers (so they can trigger every Monday, Friday, etc).
- Added a Stopwatch mode for Timers.
- Timers can now interact with Lines to trigger Tasks that Lines point towards or are over.
- Added a Rectangle tool for Map Tasks.
- Added shadows for UI elements.
- Added an optional border around window (specifically for borderless mode if you want a bit more flavor).
- Themes are now global instead of per-Project.
- Qutting MasterPlan by pressing the window's [X] now prompts for a quit.
- MasterPlan now always confirms when quitting.
- Added a keyboard shortcut to quit MasterPlan.
- Map Task type background has been slightly improved, is now a bit transparent.
- INTERNAL: Added a little darkness underneath the header for Maps.
- INTERNAL: Added remaining content types.
- FIX: Whiteboard is now NOT 2x chunkier than intended.
- INTERNAL: Get rid of data race possibility for GIF loading.
- Added shortcuts to teleport you to each end of a line, in sequence.
- The splash screen no longer takes nearly as long as it previously did to disappear. (~2.5 seconds -> 0.75 seconds)
- INTERNAL: Added relevant shortcuts for each kind of Task.
- Adding shortcuts for incrementing and decrementing Progression Tasks.
- Triggering Checkbox Tasks that have SubTasks will now trigger those SubTasks.
- Incrementing a Progression Task's current value no longer increases the maximum if they're the same.
- Timers no longer pause or reset when adjusting their values.
- Timers now can trigger neighbors when they run out.
- Timers who are neighbors to Lines can now trigger the Tasks those Lines are pointing to, and so on.
- INTERNAL: Next and Previous Line Ending's shortcuts are now the C and X keys by default.
- INTERNAL: Moving Project.Shortcuts() call above Board.Update() and Board.Draw() so that shortcut clashes can properly be resolved prior to Tasks' contents being updated or drawn.

To-do:

- Timers should be able to be set for multiple days of the week, not just one
- FIX: Enter creates a newline, but not always? Sometimes after creating a new Task and then changing its type, it doesn't work...?
- Mini-map of some description?
- Table Task Type - A grid of checkboxes you can click to toggle them, with customizeable hide-able headers on the left and top or bottom and right indicating names.
- Adding a new task no longer moves the entire stack below it??? Check deleting, too.
- Dragging a task over a stack should attempt to insert it
- Rework Board.DeleteSelectedTasks() - it no longer moves Tasks up
- Review and re-implement PasteContents()
- Review and re-implement HandleDroppedFiles()
- Make sure the binding for stopping all sounds works?
- Test support for non-latin characters (SHOULD be as simple as loading other (all?) glyphs from whatever font is available, but some things need to be tweaked for this to really work effectively); the thing that's off about this is that I need to make sure text size detection works with foreign characters or fonts. Silver.ttf in particular seems kind of off.
- Add seek option for Sounds - maybe they should be vertically two spaces tall? Maybe they should be able to EXPAND :O?
- INTERNAL: Fix Task Completion Date, it's broken
- Test project saving and loading
- Daily mode for Timers (this should be able to support more than one day, and should be able to do skips (every other, every third, etc)).
- Task streaks (not sure exactly how this will work; maybe you can turn it on, and it will reset if a day passes between the previous time it was completed and the current day?)
- Fix up missing project logging for Task Contents
- Downloading images / sounds should be able to be saved to a local directory per-project (?)
- Make top-left box for Images also work for resizing, and make an option in the Task to reset size (it's not done often enough to make it viable, I think)
- Timers should be able to retroactively trigger if a set time was passed (somehow)

---- RELEASE

- Move Board.CopyBuffer outside to a global variable so that it's possible to copy and paste between projects
- Replace Board.UndoHistory with a project-level one
- Go over the tutorial to explain things a bit more; right click to open the menu should be mentioned right at launch
- Undo + Redo for textboxes
- Panels should be resizeable
- Pasting the contents of a clipboard after directly copying a file prints some illegible characters which also mess up the textbox?
- Vertical alignment isn't really centered for textboxes?
- Display full Task text on hover
- Use URL Parsing to allow parsing text to point to other Tasks / Boards (boards are just Tasks on other Boards), or Projects so you can jump there with a click
- Similarly, extend parsing to parse text to become clickable links to be able to open files or directories
- Hide status bar elements except for the search bar if there isn't enough room horizontally
- Moveable status bar
- Searchable shortcuts
- Consolidate image and sounds into one task type?
- Review libraries to see if the licenses are compatible with my own chosen license

- Graph view that allows you to see your plan as a visual "node graph"? 
    See Nuclino: https://www.nuclino.com - It says it allows you to work in Boards and Graphs, 
    so maybe the Nodes on the Graphs should be clickable to reveal more information / reveal 
    the Task on the Board
- Smooth out panel scrolling according to texture coords?       
- Consolidate logging messages so messages that are the same get "compounded". For example:

00:00:00: "Selected 1 Tasks."
00:00:00: "Selected 1 Tasks."

becomes

00:00:00: "Selected 2 Tasks."

- Add other unicode characters to default font (←№⎢¡°ᚃ√⇒∄±∑∌≠αβχδεφγηιϑΧΔΦΓ)
- Whiteboard resolution could be increased
- Replace Board-level Undo with Project-level Undo, focus on Tasks when undoing or redoing
- Clicking in the window when the window wasn't focused should be discarded
- Display size for Tasks should be dependant on maximum theoretical feasible size (for example, a Progression Task should have a maximum size that 
includes a current number and maximum number of 999 each, so that they don't change size when incrementing or decrementing)
- Password protection
- Copying tasks between Projects
- Rotating and mirroring images
- Optional compression of project JSON (it doesn't need to be readable if compressed) - a quick idea while still keeping it in plain text JSON format is to reduce the length of the strings I use to refer to Task elements, and turn off pretty printing before serialization to remove excess tab and return characters.
- GIF Playback speed should be customizeable?
- GIF step next frame / prev. frame
- Make it so that it's easier to insert Tasks (i.e. dragging tasks into a list of them will automatically space them to make room)
t+
- Export Plan to text file somehow? 
    Checkboxes become: [ ] / [x] - TASK TEXT
    Progression becomes: [12/24] - TASK TEXT
    Notes become: NOTE: - TASK TEXT
    Timers become: DUE (X DATE) - TIMER NAME

	All other Tasks are not converted.

Long-term Goals

- Git integration (git messages can refer to Task IDs to automatically complete them)
- GUI Scaling
- Video streaming (i.e. from YouTube / Vimeo)
- Music streaming (i.e. from Spotify / SoundCloud (not sure if this is feasible, but I'd like to do it))
- Internationalization and translation to other common languages
-
