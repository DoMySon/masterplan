Whoops, I deleted the previous todo list as well. :(

That really sucks, actually.

-- Rough Changelog --

Completed:

- Completely reworked the Undo system; should be slightly more optimized (and is simpler in the code-base, as well)
- Downloading images / sounds are now multithreaded
- Modifiers (left ctrl, right ctrl) are now left / right agnostic
- Repeatable Timers / deadlines - when completing Tasks with deadlines, it advances the deadline by a certain amount of time?; Maybe it's better to have a different kind of deadline that is repeatable, and specifies simply a time frame (x days, x weeks, x months);  Maybe it's better to repurpose a Timer for this purpose, since when it goes off, it will alert you and start counting down again?
- Stopwatch mode for Timers
- Add shortcut for rectangle tool on MapImages
- Add Shadows for Buttons
- Optional border (specifically for borderless mode)
- Make themes global

To-do:

- Table Task Type - A grid of checkboxes you can click to toggle them, with customizeable hide-able headers on the left and top or bottom and right indicating names.
- Add a little darkness underneath the header for Maps
- Add quit shortcut
- Make sure the binding for stopping all sounds works?
- Speed up the splashscreen, it's too sloooooooow
- Mini-map of some description?
- Rework Board.DeleteSelectedTasks() - it no longer moves Tasks up
- Add seek option for Sounds - maybe they should be vertically two spaces tall? Maybe they should be able to EXPAND :O?
- Add remaining content types
- Support for non-latin characters (SHOULD be as simple as loading other (all?) glyphs from whatever font is available, but some things need to be tweaked for this to really work effectively)
- Get rid of data race possibility for GIF loading
- Create a window to close when X button is pressed; check "ShouldWindowClose" more often than simply once
- Test project saving and loading
- Daily mode for Timers (this should be able to support more than one day, and should be able to do skips (every other, every third, etc)).
- Task streaks (not sure exactly how this will work; maybe you can turn it on, and it will reset if a day passes between the previous time it was completed and the current day?)
- Pressing a key should teleport you to each end of a line.
- Review and re-implement PasteContents()
- Review and re-implement HandleDroppedFiles()
- Fix up missing project logging for Task Contents
- Replace Board.UndoHistory with a project-level one
- Move Board.CopyBuffer outside to a global variable so that it's possible to copy and paste between projects
- Go over the tutorial to explain things a bit more; right click to open the menu should be mentioned right at launch
- Downloading images / sounds should be able to be saved to a local directory per-project (?)
- Adding a new task no longer moves the entire stack below it??? Check deleting, too.
- Dragging a task over a stack should attempt to insert it
- Undo + Redo for textboxes
- Make top-left box for Images also work for resizing, and make an option in the Task to reset size (it's not done often enough to make it viable, I think)
- Panels should be resizeable
- Pasting the contents of a clipboard after directly copying a file prints some illegible characters which also mess up the textbox?
- Vertical alignment isn't really centered for textboxes?
- Display full Task text on hover
- Use URL Parsing to allow parsing text to point to other Tasks / Boards (boards are just Tasks on other Boards), or Projects so you can jump there with a click
- Similarly, extend parsing to parse text to become clickable links to be able to open files or directories
- Hide status bar elements except for the search bar if there isn't enough room horizontally
- Moveable status bar
- Searchable shortcuts
- Consolidate image and sounds into one task type?
- Review libraries to see if the licenses are compatible with my own chosen license

- Graph view that allows you to see your plan as a visual "node graph"? 
    See Nuclino: https://www.nuclino.com - It says it allows you to work in Boards and Graphs, 
    so maybe the Nodes on the Graphs should be clickable to reveal more information / reveal 
    the Task on the Board
- Smooth out panel scrolling according to texture coords?       
- Consolidate logging messages so messages that are the same get "compounded". For example:

00:00:00: "Selected 1 Tasks."
00:00:00: "Selected 1 Tasks."

becomes

00:00:00: "Selected 2 Tasks."

- Add other unicode characters to default font (←№⎢¡°ᚃ√⇒∄±∑∌≠αβχδεφγηιϑΧΔΦΓ)
- Whiteboard resolution could be increased
- Replace Board-level Undo with Project-level Undo, focus on Tasks when undoing or redoing
- Clicking in the window when the window wasn't focused should be discarded
- Display size for Tasks should be dependant on maximum theoretical feasible size (for example, a Progression Task should have a maximum size that 
includes a current number and maximum number of 999 each, so that they don't change size when incrementing or decrementing)
- Password protection
- Copying tasks between Projects
- Rotating and mirroring images
- Some compression of project JSON (it doesn't need to be readable if compressed)
- GIF Playback speed should be customizeable?
- GIF step next frame / prev. frame
- Make it so that it's easier to insert Tasks (i.e. dragging tasks into a list of them will automatically space them to make room)

- Export Plan to text file somehow? 
    Checkboxes become: [ ] / [x] - TASK TEXT
    Progression becomes: [12/24] - TASK TEXT
    Notes become: NOTE: - TASK TEXT
    Timers become: DUE (X DATE) - TIMER NAME

	All other Tasks are not converted.

Long-term Goals

- Git integration (git messages can refer to Task IDs to automatically complete them)
- GUI Scaling
- Video streaming (i.e. from YouTube / Vimeo)
- Music streaming (i.e. from Spotify / SoundCloud (not sure if this is feasible, but I'd like to do it))
- Internationalization and translation to other common languages
-
